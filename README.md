# Planter

This is a simple command line tool for planning your day. Reads in a wakeup time, then event titles and durations for the rest of the day.

Please don't use this as a metric for my C coding, this was thrown together quickly and is simply a proof of concept.

## Installation instructions
This can be used as is, or can be combined with an applescript to be used as an application.

**To create executable**
`make && mv planter /usr/local/bin`

**To create application**
1. Run above command
